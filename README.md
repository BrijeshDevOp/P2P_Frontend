### A Peer-to-Peer File Transfer System

![Project Banner](https://your-image-url-here.com/banner.png)

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates the use of WebRTC data channels for peer-to-peer communication. The application allows users to connect with each other and exchange data directly, without the need for a central server for data transfer (after the initial connection is established).

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Peer-to-Peer Connection**: Establishes a direct connection between two devices using WebRTC.
-   **Data Channel Communication**: Uses WebRTC data channels to send and receive text messages or other data.
-   **Signaling Server Integration**: (Assumed) Connects to a signaling server to exchange metadata for establishing the connection.
-   **Simple UI**: A clean and simple user interface to demonstrate the core functionality.

## üì° What is WebRTC?`‚Äã`

![Demo GIF](https://your-gif-url-here.com/demo.gif)

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. It allows for peer-to-peer communication, which means that data can be sent directly between two devices without needing to go through a central server. This makes it ideal for applications that require low-latency communication, such as video conferencing, voice calls, and file sharing.

The core of WebRTC is the `RTCPeerConnection` interface, which handles the connection between two peers. To establish a connection, the two devices need to exchange some information, such as their network addresses and media capabilities. This process is called **signaling** and is usually done through a separate server. Once the connection is established, data can be sent directly between the two devices using **data channels**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Android SDK**: The native platform for building the application.
-   **Java**: The primary programming language for the application logic.
-   **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: The core technology for peer-to-peer communication. This project uses the official Google WebRTC library for Android.
-   **XML**: For designing the user interface layouts.
-   **Gradle**: For dependency management and building the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   **Android Studio**: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
-   **Android SDK**: You'll need an Android SDK installed. The project is configured to use a specific version, but Android Studio should handle the installation for you.
-   **Git**: You need Git installed to clone the repository.

### Cloning the Repository

To get a local copy of the code, clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Open the project in Android Studio**:
    
    -   Launch Android Studio.
    -   Select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
    -   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select it.
2.  **Sync Gradle**:
    
    -   Android Studio will automatically start syncing the project with the Gradle files. This might take a few minutes as it downloads all the required dependencies.
3.  **Run the application**:
    
    -   Once the Gradle sync is complete, you can run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.
    -   Select your target device from the dropdown menu in the toolbar.
    -   Click the "Run" button (the green play icon) or use the shortcut `Shift + F10`.
